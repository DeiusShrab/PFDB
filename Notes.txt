TODO AT HOME
- Add tables for Terrain, Time, Plane. Add them to the Model.
- Update MonsterSpawn tables to include new tables, make BestiaryId non-null
- Make sure all Bestiary entries have a MonsterSpawn entry, even if it's all nulls
- Write sproc for GenerateRandomEncounters

- Write up Alter scripts for the first three entries to return them to their original status after Transform
- Run the Transformer (first pass)
- Verify that Transformer worked. If it did, run for entire db.

- Get a count of non-null entries for each column. Make sure the column is not nullable if there are 0 null entries.
- Consider moving low-pop columns to separate tables.
- Check interaction between [Bestiary].Environment, Feat, Language, Skill and new tables
- Write up (or pseudocode) Transformer code to split them up

Remove columns from [Bestiary]:
Mythic bool

[Bestiary] NPCs
Use the CharacterFlag column for NPCs, and have it set for intelligent beings that might interact with the party instead of fight them

CreatureInfoBrowser
On first page-load, add the loaded info to a local memory item. Like a dictionary or something. Always check this cache item before loading from the web.
Also cap it at like ten items to prevent memory leaks.

[BrowserCacheItem] MonsterId, LastUsed, MonsterText

Continent-Terrain
Use for automatic encounter chances, tie an encounter % to each one
When encounter is rolled, randomize Time list. List can then be adjusted if needed before grabbing monsters.

Plane
Used for things like other planes and planets (and the moon). Overrides all other encounter selectors when set to something besides 'Prime Material'

[Time]
TimeId
Name
IsDay

Times: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, First Watch, Second Watch, Third Watch
(For the current game, treat them all as awake during third watch and half of them awake during first and second)

Travel Time (Notebook, not app)
Add modifiers like +1 for Ring of Sustenance (less sleep)
+1 for on-road, adjust base travel accordingly

Combat Tracker
Skip entries with 0 or lower Init on Next Turn

[Month] needs an Abbreviation column

[Holiday] HolidayId, Month, Day, Continent, StartingYear(?), YearsBetween(?) (last two for 10-year, 100-year, etc celebrations)

Calendar on the PFSite where PCs can mark upcoming dates and see holiday celebrations
