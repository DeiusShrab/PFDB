TODO AT HOME
Add School and SubSchool to DB
Update DB to match DBModels
Add Misc items to DB (Months, Seasons, etc)
Backup DB somehow
Generate code-first for updated DB stuff
Set up HTTPS to access the api (but not the main site)
Get the got-dang MAPS UP
	Touch them up first with more locations and proper city names
	Remember that maps only show "major" locations, small towns and villages won't be there
Make some kind of DB Importer that pulls PFSRD stuff, runs it through the formatter from Test, and adds it to the DB

DB STUFF
- Get a count of non-null entries for each column. Make sure the column is not nullable if there are 0 null entries.
- Consider moving low-pop columns to separate tables.
- Check interaction between [Bestiary].Environment, Feat, Language, Skill and new tables
- Write up (or pseudocode) Transformer code to split them up

[Bestiary] NPCs
Use the CharacterFlag column for NPCs, and have it set for intelligent beings that might interact with the party instead of fight them
Dump the NPC table into the Bestiary table with appropriate transformations and this flag set

Continent-Terrain
Use for automatic encounter chances, tie an encounter % to each one
When encounter is rolled, randomize Time list. List can then be adjusted if needed before grabbing monsters.

Plane
Used for things like other planes and planets (and the moon). Overrides all other encounter selectors when set to something besides 'Prime Material'

[Time]
TimeId
Name
IsDay

Times: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, First Watch, Second Watch, Third Watch
(For the current game, treat them all as awake during third watch and half of them awake during first and second)

Travel Time (Notebook, not app)
Add modifiers like +1 for Ring of Sustenance (less sleep)
+1 for on-road, adjust base travel accordingly

Combat Tracker
Some kind of turn tracker (color row differently?)
Skip entries with 0 initiative
Math in rows (-hp, +hp)
Color rows with dead monsters (grey) or players (red)

[Month] needs an Abbreviation column

[Holiday] HolidayId, Month, Day, Continent, StartingYear(?), YearsBetween(?) (last two for 10-year, 100-year, etc celebrations)

Demon's Day - anniversary of The Altering, last day of the year, stronger effects on multiples of 10 (e.g. year xx1000 will be more intense than year xxx100, which will be more intense than xxxx10)

Calendar on the PFSite where PCs can mark upcoming dates and see holiday celebrations
